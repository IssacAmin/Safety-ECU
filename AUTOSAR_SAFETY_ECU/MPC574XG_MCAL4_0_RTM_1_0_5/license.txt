PRODUCT LABELING.  You are not authorized to use any NXP trademarks, brand names, or logos.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and NXP regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior communications, negotiations, understandings, agreements or representations, either written or oral, if any. This Agreement may only be amended in written form, executed by you and NXP.

SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and, unless a modification or replacement of the invalid or unenforceable provision is further held to deprive you or NXP of a material benefit, in which case the Agreement will immediately terminate, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to the intention underlying the invalid or unenforceable provision.

NO WAIVER.  The waiver by NXP of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent breach of the same or a different provision.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Licensee agrees to retain the Confidential Information in confidence perpetually, with respect to Software in source code form (human readable), or for a period of 3 years from the date of receipt of the Confidential Information, with respect to all other Confidential Information. During this period the Licensee may not disclose NXP's Confidential Information to any third party except where such disclosure is necessary in order to achieve the purpose of the license because the automotive customer requires disclosure in conjunction with the testing or purchase of an Authorized System and who have executed written agreements obligating them to protect such Confidential Information. During this period Licensee will also limit dissemination of the Confidential Information to its employees or contractors who have a need to know of the Confidential Information and who have executed written agreements obligating them to protect such Confidential Information, and may not use the NXP's Confidential Information for any purpose or in any manner not authorized by this Agreement. The Licensee further agrees to use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, with NXP's Confidential Information as it would with its own confidential information. The Licensee may disclose Confidential Information as required by a court or under operation of law or order provided that the Licensee notifies NXP of such requirement prior to disclosure, that the Licensee discloses only that information required, and that the Licensee allows NXP the opportunity to object to such court or other legal body requiring such disclosure.

ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, or any of its rights, interests, duties or obligations, without the prior written approval of NXP.  NXP may assign this Agreement without the consent or approval of Licensee.  For clarity, the proposed acquisition transaction involving Qualcomm Inc. ("Qualcomm"), which was publicly announced on October 27, 2016, shall not constitute an assignment by operation of law, and NXP may assign this Agreement to Qualcomm or any subsidiary thereof in connection with or following completion of the acquisition.
